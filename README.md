# Identification of Muons in the LHCb Detector

This repository contains code and resources for identifying muons in the LHCb detector using machine learning techniques. The LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) experiment is one of the four main experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, specializing in the study of particles containing bottom quarks.

## Repository Structure
